Custom Keyboards for iOS allows you to create a keyboard `inputView` that looks and feels just like the iPad or iPhone/iPod touch keyboard. It is particularly useful for developers who are looking to add keyboard input for language that is not natively supported by iOS. The included example project is for a Punjabi keyboard.

## Installation & Usage

### Setup

Add the `iPad` and/or `iPhone:iPod` directory to your target in Xcode. `PKCustomKeyboard.h` contains all of the customizable constants for the iPad keyboard. `PMCustomKeyboard.h` contains all of the customizable constants for the iPhone/iPod touch keyboard. Characters in the `kChar` array can start or end with ◌ (U+25CC) and the ◌ will not appear when inputted into the textView. This is particularly useful for diacritical characters.

Make sure to import `PKCustomKeyboard.h` and `PMCustomKeyboard.h` into your view controller's header file.

### Usage
Insert the following into the `viewDidLoad` of your view controller or wherever else you see fit. You can `setTextView` to any `UITextView` or `UITextField` that you want the keyboard to appear for.

```objective-c

if ( UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone )
    {
        PMCustomKeyboard *customKeyboard = [[PMCustomKeyboard alloc] init];
        [customKeyboard setTextView:self.textView];
        
    }
    else {
        PKCustomKeyboard *customKeyboard = [[PKCustomKeyboard alloc] init];
        [customKeyboard setTextView:self.textView];
    }

```
